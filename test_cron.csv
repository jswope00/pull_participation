"Front-line work, Front-line issue.","A paramount factor affecting Global Health is the count of ‘Frontline Health Worker’ or simply, Healthcare workers. They are the primary source of care in health institutions (hospitals, clinics, etc.) including doctors, long-term caregivers, end-of-life caretakers, palliative caregivers, nurses, community health workers, midwives, and even pharmacists.  There is an overall shortage of skilled healthcare workers in the industry, especially in developing countries and among underserved populations (low access to healthcare). Healthcare workers are indispensable, and they address a number of other significant Global issues directly or indirectly.  

Health workers are necessary for primary care, educating or creating awareness among the population about health-related concerns, analyzing and interpreting healthcare data, voicing healthcare issues or needs, administering safely vaccines and contraceptives, implementing safe medical interventions, managing diseases and ensuring availability of safe drugs, catering to the advancing needs of society as climates change, tweaking health resources as diet/nutrition changes, and more.

They also face many challenges as they need to renew training based on the global health environment (changing lifestyle or societal needs, new diseases, newer complications, new drugs or methods, managing the clinic or hospital, etc.) to sharpen their skills. They have to overcome social, economic, geographic or political hurdles. There is an issue of safety, especially for healthcare workers in places of constant protest, wars or gun violence. They need to have access to necessary information and resources at the right time and place. Sometimes there are gender issues (male-female ratio, male health workers have higher pay, gender harassment, etc.)They’ll have to deal with diverse patients and balance the treatment with the patients’ religious, personal or cultural beliefs (e.g. non-belief in vaccines, uneducated patients, etc.). Diversity also means dealing with people having varying insurance coverage.

Recent estimates are that there will be a shortage of 12.9 million healthcare workers by 2035, from the current figure of 7.2 million. Although there are measures taken up by many World Organizations to counter this, it is not enough and will take a lot more to get skilled and dedicated health workers to overcome this deficit.

"Stigmatisation as a Global Health Issue","I can speak for the Caribbean, but I am sure that this issue exists anywhere you go around the world.  There are some groups of persons who are stigmatised by their illness or maybe due to the subculture to which they belong.  Health professionals, as persons who also live in the same or similar communities, will carry with them the same fears and behaviours knowing or unknowing to them.  This would lead to those in these unfortunate groups to avoid treatment until it is absolutely necessary, or they may receive different care as opposed to their more socially accepted counterparts.  This would inevitably lead to a disparity in care.","AbiJames"
,"I agree with some points here. Yes lifestyle diseases are definitely among important health issues in the developed contries. But I do not think that this is the case for undeveloped contries where communicable diseases most definitely cause major problems together with undernutrition due to poverty. So I tend to agree woth ChristerlynCharles that poverty is the most important health issue. Undernutrition can lead to a poor immune defence and thereby a higher chance of catching a disease. 
","Acbir"
"What do you think is the most important Global Health Issue and Why?","I think the most important Global health issue is that of global infectious diseases such as Ebola and the potential that because of the change in weather and climate, because of cultural change and economic change, the spread of these diseases are more likely. 
I would also submit that another issue is the seeming decline of people wanting to study in the science field such as Medicine or Nursing, due to things such as 'pay cuts' etc. This may not be as major an issue, but if more hands were on board and more reminds came together, it may be easier to control the spread of diseases.","AliaDeb"

,"There are some good points made in the argument but we are currently producing more food per capita than ever before and are more efficient with our resources.  Somehow there is a mismatch with poverty and resources available to the poor.  We therefore have to ask the question - the richer are richer then ever and there are more rich people,  so, is it not therefore an issue of getting the worlds resources to the poor and to have a more even distribution?  The answer is complex and only by consistent sustainable change will there be any marked difference.  Take for instance someone from the first world who has an idea for a business which is honourable and is prepared to invest, with risk, in a project which is virtually scoffed at.  It provides for the first world but the spin off is that it supports the local developing country.  Over time, and with prudence, there is massive change in the economy, the business grows, involves international issues of conflict, becomes a global brand and all the time is reinvesting in the initial project.  This can only be sustained with a population; not with contraception.  you think it will never work, but alas it has, the guy is Charlie Modica, we are the result of thinking beyond.","AustinKirwan"
,"Water is a massive issue which if not tackled correctly will cause disaster, the writer is correct however there another angle to this.  Water has become a valuable commodity, oil has been a cause of much strive and warfare however the battle for the future will propably be over water.  Take the Nile, it flows through many countries but who owns the water of has the right to harvest it? By the time the Nile delta in Egypt is reached is bares only a resemblance to its source.  Along the way it is violated.  Countries will recognise that they will have to manage such issues well with international agreements as to has access to water, what to do with waste and this has to be tied, in with irritations, land management and the resultant health issues.  It is predicted the next world war will be over water.  Interestingly the drinks industry in dev.eloping countries comes in for much criticism by taking valuable water from deprived regions and producing drink that teach the world to sing.  The reality in one view is that they have a clean drink of one sort to survive with which is cleaner than the local water; then when the y sing at least everyone can hit the high notes.","AustinKirwan"
"Globalization of Travel - posing major health challenges ","Travelers can serve as sentinels for disease, and thereby contribute to the global disease surveillance system. The elimination of spatial and temporal barriers, especially by long-distance air transport, means that humans can reach almost any part of the Earth today within the incubation period for most microbes that cause disease in humans. Travelers are part of the dynamic global process of moving biota, along with trade, which moves plants, animals, and other materials. One consequence of this movement is the juxtaposition of species that have never before had physical proximity. Potential consequence of the movement of species, such as arthropods, mammals and other animals, and plants, whether intentional or inadvertent, is the establishment of species in new geographic areas. These introductions may cause major changes in the existing ecosystem. The most recent global pandemic, involving the H1N1 swine flu, spread to 23 countries within six weeks of being discovered in Mexico in 2009.","BhumikaSharma"
"What do you think is the most important Global Health Issue and Why?","In my view, the most important global health issue is the disparities in healthcare system.  Why do I say so? If we had good quality healthcare system that catered for all levels of prevention then in all parts of the world, we would not need to worry about the spread of diseases from one part of the world to the other. We would have better primary prevention capacity, to stop diseases before they occur; and even bar them from crossing borders. Even if they crossed boarders, wherever they occur, then they would be managed in a timely manner. However, because of the poor system in developing countries, some diseases have occurred without being detected and affected people in these resource constrained countries; sometimes evolved into ‘newer’ and stronger (or, more virulent) forms, which easily cross boarders and affect populations in other parts of the world.","Byonanebye"

"most important global health issue(s)","There are two  basics issues which are important  to be in Balance. They do not only influences each other but every other global issue. Poverty en the depletion of fossil materials. One is dependent on the other. At this point we live in A world with lots of knowledge on all sorts of issues.Daily Life became easier (for western society), washing machines, television, good health care etc. But all this is possible in spite of our precious global resources en leads to pollution. Which affects the environment and adverse health problems. However we do need sources of energie to continue development on a social, medical and economical bases.

Poverty must be reduced by Education and a healthy economic in developing countries This eventually contributes to a healthy environment and sustainable society and therefore a Sustainable healthy World.","Car"
"Global Health Issue","I think that the most Global Health Issue we are facing is linked to extreme poverty and the fact that so many people still do not have access to basic health care, to proper sanitation, to education (especially concerning diseases and their transmission). 
Those difficult conditions of living clearly helps diseases to develop and spread. If we pay attention to what is going on in countries like Guinea and Liberia, theses issues are probably the biggest reasons why we still cannot contain Ebola outbreak. The lack of infrastructures is terrible for doctors/nurses to help patient to be correctly diagnosed and treated. 
There are other issues of course, but this one is according to me the main one. And it have to be address by everyone, every country because, even if it happens far away from our home sweet home (despite the fact that it happens to fellow humans and this only consideration should be enough for everyone to feel concerned) it can lead to a global outbreak if the pathogen is contagious enough and with new tendencies of human beings to travel all around the world, it can spread then easily... Ebola outbreak is showing us what it can be!

"The Most Important Global Health Issue","I think the most important global health issue is climate change.  The effects of climate change has already proven to be a major threat to human and animal health.  Global warming results in high sea level.  Countries with low-lying coastlines and small islands are most vulnerable.  The resulting flooding not only damages infrastructure.  Flood waters holds and transports many harmful micro-organisms such as those that causes leptospirosis, typhoid, and other acute diarrhoeal diseases, and also allows the breeding of mosquito which causes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya.  Skin infections are also possible.  Flooding could also compromise community potable water supply.  In addition, elevated temperature has contributed to other health issues such as hypertension, strokes, heart diseases and asthma.  Flood waters also impact crops and livestock production, and fishing activities, which could result in stress related illnesses, food shortage, and under nutrition.  On the other hand prolonged dry seasons leads to drought thus food shortages.  Climate change thus directly or indirectly impact on global health by threatening food security and affecting morbidity and mortality rates.  ","DENVES"
"Global Health Issue","This is a very interesting question.From a public health perspective, each health issue whether it is from HIV/AIDS or advocacy for strengthening health systems,is important. However, after analysis of what may have the most adverse impact on people globally, other issues may take precedence. Ebola virus disease is definitely one such health issue being of international concern.The overwhelming number of deaths, mutations of the virus, previously limited information known about the disease although endemic to West Africa are some of the reasons why there is general concerne.Despite this however, much is done to address and contain persons'fears and the disease leaning a lot of trusted public health approaches.

"The most important Global Health issue ","
Climate change and its impact on the health of the world’s population can be deemed as the most important global health issue. Population growth and man’s actions impact heavily on the climatic conditions experienced. 

Worldwide, climate change is responsible for numerous deaths and diseases from hunger and malnutrition as a result of droughts; respiratory ailments due to air pollution; diseases carried and transmitted by rodents and vectors such as mosquitoes and the scarcity of and the inadequate water supply.

Additionally, sea level rise due to melting polar caps increases coastal erosion and flooding causing persons to become refugees in their own country. This migration in-land, leads to deforestation and encroachment on the natural habitat of the wild. These breeches result in the interaction between man and animal and the transmittal of various infectious diseases.

Heatwaves are expected to increase in frequency in the coming years creating serious health risks such as skin cancers, syncope (fainting episodes), skin rash and hyperthermia. A continual rise in temperature and prolonged warm seasons allows disease-carrying mosquitoes to move from tropical areas to other normally temperate regions introducing malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya and other tropical diseases.

Increases in rainfall and extreme winters, have become common place. Heavy rains pose the risk of significant flooding. Flooding added to improper or a lack of sanitation practices impacts on the health of persons in these areas. The rise in temperature (droughts) and increased rainfall exaggerates the poverty level as crops and meat productions are greatly affected.

The warming of the world’s oceans also impacts on livelihoods, as well as leads to an increase in the red tide phenomenon and other harmful algae blooms. Red tide causes nausea and vomiting and in some cases brain damage and paralysis in swimmers and surfers who ingest these waters. A recent example of this was seen in Sarasota Florida in 2013 were a significant fish kill as a result of this phenomenon was experienced, resulting in beach goers experiencing respiratory issues. The first case of this was recorded in 1793 in British Colombia, Canada. In 1987, on Prince Edward Island 150 persons became ill after consuming contaminated shell fish of which 4 died.

"The most important global health issue","I find this question a little hard to answer because, like so much of public health, there are many problems that are equally as responsible for poor health. Things such as poor nutrition, unequal distribution of resources, and lack of education are some examples of issues that intersect where the presence of one leads to exacerbation of the others. If I were to pick one, it would definitely be the unequal distribution of resources. Everyone talks about the shortage of food and lack of basic necessities but there are countries that are more than capable of producing their own food and supporting their populations off of it. Trade and profit has made food a commodity so there are countries exporting large amounts of food with parts of their population still suffering from hunger. There are technologies harnessed by many countries that help to filter water and create irrigations systems that bring water to areas where water is lacking yet there are towns and villages that still have to walk long distances to collect drinking water. In talking about resources, I am talking about food, technology, knowledge, power, and basically anything that can be shared among countries but hasn't been properly integrated. Although I know that this can easily be connected to a lack of education or greed, its a simple idea that sharing what we have and know about something should be able to make changes in areas where a problem still exists. ","GreeshmaH"
,"I also think that the growing population is a big threat. Not only by reproduction, but humans are getting older and older. Older people are more susceptible for a lot of infections and can serve as a reservoir.
Of course the climate change! The biggest threat, not in 10 years, but in 100 years or so.","Inske"
"The most important Global Health Issue and Why?","The most important global health issue is rapidity of spread of infectious disease that is trans-boundary and made possible by the shrinking of the global village. Current and ongoing Ebola pandemic is a classical example. The rapidity of spread is made possible by air travel. Not only is the Ebola infection, but the lack of vaccine is a huge challenge. While progress has been made in diagnosis of Ebola, much needs to be made especially to benefit the people in the countries of the outbreak who are socio-economically disadvantaged and are bearing the brunt of the outbreak with continuing morbidity and mortality.

"most important Global Health issue","i really believe the HIV virus and AIDS is the greatest threat. it's such a silent killer. there are millions of people infected in the world today, with new cases diagnosed everyday. there is no hope for a large majority of these people in regards to access to healthcare and medications. Not to mention, the lack of education that surrounds the disease is still so shocking in some parts of the world. It affects both genders, all ages and cultural backgrounds.","JamesTheGreater04"
"Most Important Global Health Issue","	

	Poverty is the most important global health issue. The World Health Organization has called poverty the “world’s biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill-health and suffering.” Using the World Bank’s definition, poverty can be defined as “households or individuals not having enough resources or abilities today to meet their needs.” Poverty is both the cause and result inequality in the distribution of wealth and resources. As many of my colleagues have already touched on, there is a huge disparity of wealth throughout the world. In fact, the wealth of the one percent richest people in the world amounts to $110 trillion, which is 65 times the total wealth of the bottom half of the world’s population. Additionally, the poorest 40 % of the world’s population accounts for 5 % of the global income; whereas the richest 20 % accounts for three-quarters of the world’s income. Moreover, almost half the world, over 3 billion people, live on less than $2.50 a day. The disparity of wealth is a problem in both developing and developed countries. For instance, in the US, the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of post-financial crisis growth since 2009, while the bottom 90 percent became poorer.

Socioeconomic status is also a significant predictor of physical and mental health in that, throughout the world, the poorest people have the worst health. There are many factors for this inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and risk of poor health such as people in poverty more likely to live in unsafe environments and lack access to health care. Globally, poverty puts people at greater risk for many health problems such as malnutrition, diseases from unsafe drinking water, greater risk of both infectious and chronic diseases, higher rates of infant/child/and mother mortality, greater risk of violence related injuries, and an increased risk of mental health problems. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each year due to poverty, 2.2 million children die each year because they are not immunized, and around 30 percent of all children in developing countries are estimated to be underweight and have stunted growth. Moreover, over 1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to water, 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation, and close to half of all people in developing nations at any given time suffer from health problem from water and sanitation defect.  Furthermore, worldwide, one billion people lack access to health care systems. Infectious diseases continue to blight the lives of the poor across the world. In fact, every year Tuberculosis kills 1.7 million people with a significant portion being in lower socioeconomic populations.  Additionally, there are 2.7 million new infections of HIV every year and poorer populations at a much higher risk of becoming infected. In the USA, over 78 percent of new HIV cases are among citizens living under the poverty line or incarcerated individuals.  

Poverty is even such as serious health problem that it significantly lowers one’s life expectancy. For example, there is a huge disparity in wealth between developing/poorer countries and developed wealthier countries, in that the least developed, poorest countries life expectancy is only 49 years old and 1 in 10 children do not reach their first birthday. Whereas, in high-income developed countries, the average life span 77 years only and infant mortality is only 6 per 1000 live births. Nevertheless, even within wealthier/developed countries, living in poverty lowers a person’s life expectancy. For instance, according to the WHO report by the chair of commission, Sir Michael Marmot. Even within a country such as the UK, the average-life span can differ by on average 28 years depending on whether you are in the poorer or wealthier sections of society.

,"In the United States, the issue goes beyond the cost of health insurance or even the doctor's visit. The cost of medications can be outrageous. For example, one Symbicort 160mcg inhaler for asthma costs over $250, even with discounts.  For how many asthma patients is this price out of reach?  Now imagine the implications for someone who contracts a transmissible disease (HIV/AIDS, Ebola) and does not get treated because of either lack of funds or lack of access.","JillS"
,"In West Africa, there is tremendous stigma against Ebola patients (even survivors).  In this case, some of the patients being stigmatized are health care workers who contracted the disease by treating previous Ebola patients.  I have even read of family members being shunned and ostracized.

Nor is stigmatization limited to the developing world.  It is also an issue in developed countries.  I remember the HIV/AIDS Education and Awareness campaigns from the 80's and 90's.  People needed to be educated on how HIV is and is not spread.  Besides lack of awareness, there was often lack of compassion as well.","JillS"
"Consideration of Economic Disparity as the most important Global Health Issue","The most important Global Health issue, in my opinion, has to be economic disparity. To most diseases and complications leading to health issues, there are prevention that can be done, immediate/first aid emergency care available, secondary/follow-up/or long term cares available, and in some other diseases recurrence incidents can be controlled. However, not everyone can afford because of the economic disparity of the country itself, sub-divisions of the country (provinces/states/cities), and/or of the individual. If the country or sub-divisions of it cannot obtain adequate technology, knowledge, and cures/alleviates, even though the methods of prevention and control exist, the individuals in need will not be obtaining the services/health care. Likewise, zooming in to an individual’s economic status, he or she might also not be able to afford even though all those are available. Narrowing down or eliminating economic disparity and promotion of communications and exchanges of medical knowledge and technology between developed and developing AND the specific region with the source of disease/complications with outer science and health communities are crucial to benefit this aspect of One Health, One Medicine, from an One World perspective.","KMK"
"Limited public health access, a global issue","In my opinion, the lack of education and access to information in the primary care and preventive medicine areas, are the main issues globally; if we thought about it, we can see that the major current health problems are a consequence of this, such is the case of the high rate of pregnancy in young females that statistically proven occurs mainly in impoverished population; as the mother is not prepared for such a responsibility it is unlikely the new born can get everything that is needed for a proper development, triggering a series of unfortunate events that will go on during the life cycle of this individual; unchaining more poverty, hunger, limited access to health services and education, overpopulation etc., and this becomes a cycle that repeats and expands over time and despite the efforts of the government and health care in many countries this issue remains and is widening in many areas nowadays.","Karesa"

"Most Important Global Health Issue ","The world has so many global health issues but I think the most important health issue we have is the spread of infectious diseases particularly those that are airborne. On a day-to-day basis people interact with people in order to obtain goods and services. Some persons may not be traveler but may interact with people who interact with travelers regular. In this modern world of industries, travel of both goods and services are mandatory especially since about 20% of the world population struggle to access resources of the world. In addition, people need to breath in order to stay alive. 

The mentioned actions makes it impossible to eradicate the spread of infectious diseases without affecting the economic flow of the world. I said impossible because the economic activities of this world is seen as more important that eradicating infectious diseases and thus, traveling cannot be stopped.","Kensuke"
"Most important Global Health Issue","While a lot of issues need to be address and tackle, I think the most important global health issue is the availability of quality fresh water supply. Many contagious diseases such as cholera and EHEC. Vector-borne water-related diseases such as malaria and snail-borne disease schistosomiasis are also tightly related to water supply. Quoted from WHO website, ""Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio. Contaminated drinking-water is estimated to cause more than 500 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year"". With the effects from climate change, irregularity of rainfall patterns will become more apparent. Some places will see more hundred-year floods, while others may see historic drought. Flood water is often contaminated by chemicals and all sort of pathogens. Each year waterborne diseases kills almost 600,000 children aged under 5. In the other end, extreme drought at certain regions are likely to worsen. According to IPCC recent report, climate change is likely to widen the area affected by drought, double the frequency of extreme droughts and increase their average duration six-fold by the 2090s. Secondary effects of extreme drought include famine and heat related illness. 

Measures such as policies, relocation, relevant infrastructures, and education are needed to ensure clean and safe water source for all people in this century as we slowly adapt to the rippling effects of climate change.","Kongming30"

"The Ebola virus","The spread of the Ebola virus, which causes the Ebola disease, is the major Global Health issue presently for a number of reasons. Firstly, this fatal disease,for which there is no widely accessible cure, is difficult to control, since the virus is transmitted from human to human, through bodily fluids,which had originally been contracted from non-primate animals. International travel allows for extensive movement of this virus as asymptomatic and symptomatic people could move from nation to nation, which has occurred recently, since there is freedom to travel, so that normal, daily, essential activities could continue. The fact is that some countries in the world are inadequately equipped to contain the presence of the virus in any particular place. Thus, leading to a degeneration in worldwide health status and a loss of human resource in different regions which would also in turn lead to global decline in economic resources, because all nations are interdependent.

"Poverty ","
 

 I think the most important global health issue is poverty. Poverty can affect health in several ways. One can be too poor to access basic health care. Also a country can be too poor to provide basic health care. 
If health care cannot be provided then the population is at risk of dying from treatable and preventable diseases like malaria TB etc.
People living in poverty cannot buy medicine  for diseases that easily treated . If a country is poor it would not be able to undergo any research that will help on the treatment of some disease. For this reasons and more I think poverty is an important global health tissue

"Which Global Health is the most important and Why","I personally believe that poverty is the most important global health issue.  Many different events as well as many different problems can directly be linked to poverty, and I feel that if we could solve this issue than many different problems which we face today would be eradicated.  For example many developing countries have the lowest morality rates for children, mainly because the basic medical needs cannot be satisfied.  In addition to this diseases which are spread much more rapidly, and I feel that all of this would be able to be solved if the standard of living were to go up.  Basic vaccinations would be available, and it would be much easier to diagnose problems in patients.  
In addition to this helping eliminate poverty would help education rates as well.  A simple google search and anyone can see that most regions (or countries) where poverty exists, there are lower education rates there as well.
Its amazing to note that all of this ties together, one thing leading to the other, thus solving the root cause, would help either eliminate other issues which stem, or greatly help reduce those occurrences. ","Manik"
"Most important Global Health Issue and Why...","I think there is a combination of issues rather than one to focus on and often they are linked together.

"The most important global health issue","It still always shocks me of the great disparity that exists between the wealthiest people in this world and everyone else. The fact that less than 10% of the world's population controls over 80% of the world's resources is appalling and certainly has an impact on Global Health. The majority of the money and resources are tied up and those individuals living in poverty have little to no access to appropriate health care. People living in remote areas may have to travel far distances to even see a doctor, as a result losing out on a day's wages, if not more, and then may not even have the money to be treated appropriately. The clinics in the very regions that these individuals turn to may not even be equipped with the necessary diagnostic tools or medicines due to a lack of funding. Thus, once exposed, these individuals not only pose a threat to their own health, but to the health of friends, family, etc as well. The finances simply are not there to combat health issues. And while others may imagine the situation of Africa in remote villages as a perfect example, it is important to restate that greater than 80% of the worlds resources are in the hands of less than 10% of the world's population, this means that the problem hits close to home. In my case, home is back in the United States, you have the few filthy rich individuals and then you have the majority of us. Although, the middle class and working class have an income, there are still some who cannot even afford health insurance, and then you also have homeless individuals. If exposed to infectious diseases these individuals could end up harboring them and passing them on due to a lack of funds with which to get treatment. In the end, money saves lives. With money you can seek out health care 1. as a routine exam 2. as a result of illness - seeking treatment 3. as a prophylactic method and 4. you can spread awareness and educate the public about potential health risks and how best to care for oneself.","MelissaN"

So let's compare GFR between a healthy individual and an individual with low CO. 

The low CO individual has a low GFR. If this person had no Ang 2 then the GFR would be even lower! So angiotensin 2 helps to increase filtration fraction and increase GFR above a pathological low GFR, but not above normal!

So ranking we would have a normal individual with a normal GFR. With low CO and angiotensin 2 the GFR is low but not as low as if the person with low CO and on an angiotensin blocker drug! Hence why we do not use ace inhibitors with renal problems!

Remember no individual has an angiotensin response in isolation, usually there is also a sympathetic output and affrent resistance is low too!","Murray"

"MOST IMPORTANT GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE","I believe that it is difficult to pin-point which issue in the list of pressing public health concerns around the world, is most important.

If I were to try and decide, I would say that the Ebola outbreak that started in West Africa and has found its way into industrialized countries such as the United States, is of serious concern.

With the on-set and spread of this disease, the importance of access to health care and available health services has become evident. Ebola, when contracted, takes less than 3 weeks to manifest and possibly can cost the life of the patient. Thus it is important that containment and remedies to such diseases are researched ahead of time to remain prepared in an outbreak.","Oge"
"Global Health Equity","In my opinion, the number one issue that takes precedence over all the problems that plague us worldwide is the enormous disparity in health care availability among those around the world. Issues like climate change, clean water access, nutrition, vaccinations and prevention/treatment of multitudes of other diseases are made many times worse by the failure of health care delivery in developing countries. All of the aforementioned issues are certainly important and must be dealt with swiftly, but I believe a main priority should be increasing access to the most basic health care for those who lack it. Health care is a human right just like any other, and if someone does not have access to basic health then a substandard quality of life will not allow them to succeed and have a happy and fulfilling life. ","Priya"
"What do you think is the most important Global Health Issue and Why?","
I believe that the most important global health issue today is the lack of vaccinated children in developing countries. According to the Centers of Disease control, vaccines prevent approximately 2.5 million deaths per year for children younger than 5 years old. However, because many parts of the world do not have access to these immunizations/vaccinations, there are many lives that are lost at a staggering rate. 

As discussed throughout this course, diseases and sicknesses travel across countries and continents due to the migration of people and livestock. A reoccurrence of a disease can enter a country that is not well equipped to handle the consequences. However, if the majority of the population is vaccinated (assuming this condition has a viable vaccine), the chance of this disease spreading and infecting individuals is much lower. 

Because many countries are poor and do not have adequate resources to open up clinics for citizens to receive health care, it is extremely difficult to provide necessary medical attention to the population. Perhaps there is a shortage of doctors, nurses, trained personnel; perhaps it is the inability to deliver vaccines and other basic medications to the clinic; or perhaps it is the lack of appropriate means to house patients and medicines (no electricity, sanitation, etc.)

"Most Important global health issue and why?","Hi all,

To say that there is ""a most important global health issue"" will be remiss and injudicious of me. Global health issue differs by country. In Trinidad for e.g. Obesity is becoming a national issue; diabetes and HIV are also on the list. 
Globally, countries are battling with the onset of various cancers and heart condition, hypertension among others. 
At present, the zoonotic disease of concern is Ebola virus. Whilst countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia are battling to curb the spread of the disease. Other countries, I am sure are reviewing their Conventions and legislation, health Acts and Health care systems' standard operating Procedures to ensure that they are prepared for an outbreak or to more proactively prevent an outbreak of the disease. This especially holds true for developing countries who most times lack the financial resources and capacity to deal with diseases of such a destructive nature. Preventative measures are imperative for SIDS and efforts should focus on preventing entry of persons with the disease. At present in Trinidad, there is a drive to have no Carnival celebrations next year. I believe this is a wise  and sensible decision that would benefit the island. However, there are so many against this move. Time will tell!","RShoy"
"The most important health issue","The most important health issue in my opinion would be the economic disparities of the world. The earth resources are disproportionately distributed, with only less than 10% consuming more than 80% of the worlds resources.
This leads to a huge amount of the world population to live in poverty and with poverty certain circumstances prevail: Lack of hygiene, inability to access health services, malnutrition, exposure to harmful environments, etc. The situation promotes appearance of disease and deterioration of public health. The lack of resources also makes people exploit in ineffective ways the little resources available, allowing contamination and disruption of ecosystems.
Poverty and extreme economic disparity promotes a world that deteriorates over time, and generates circumstances from where the environment might not recover. These factors deteriorate health and make human life unsustainable.","RicardoMG"
,"I totally agree with you, the global health issue the vector borne diseases.  The fact remains that due to the  drastic climate changes and more travel of persons throughout the region.

Based on the virus' virulence and its associated morbidity & mortality, countries around the globe are preparing for the war against Ebola.  Canada recently pledged to invest $40 million to prepare for an Ebola outbreak.  They are purchasing vaccine and getting prepared.  Amazing the investments being made for a virus that hasn't even hit their shores!!  However, the virus' impact on a country's healthcare system together with its social & economic impacts are of great concern. It has been a great example of how human global travel can facilitate the movement of a disease not only across borders, but across oceans!  A handful of people have travelled from Ebola-infected regions unsymptomatic and headed home (Spain, USA) only to develop symptoms once they have reached their homeland.  In these cases, the physician's inquiry into his/her patient's travel history is of utmost importance!  Allowing Ebola to go ""viral"" around the globe will result in the New Age ""Plague"" and will have significant and global consequences. It will take every health care stakeholder's efforts around the world to join together as a united front to protect us against the spread of this deadly virus.","TPat"
"My Opinion of the Most Important Global Health Issue...The What and Why","In my opinion, the most important global health issues are apathy and ignorance.  Even though we are currently more of a global society than ever before, we still at times operate in a silo, and are (seemingly) unaffected by what goes on around us, unless of course there is a fear of imminent effect or danger.

I would like to use the following examples to illustrate this point:

When Ebola was limited to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there was no rush, desire, or ""need"" to spring into action. (My interpretation of) The general stance was ""this isn't something that directly affects us, so we will sit silently by, and let those who are directly affected, handle it. Big pharma wasn't actively working to control, eradicate, or even understand the virus. The treatments that had been formulated were created in small doses, which were administered to the outsiders that were there treating those stricken with Ebola, in West Africa... The patient population to whom it is endemic were, and are still left to fend for themselves.

HIV/AIDS is another example. When it was thought that it was limited to certain population types, the scientific, healthcare and pharma communities weren't going out of their way trying to prevent transmission.  After it became more widespread and affected varying populations in various geographic locations, and the effects started to be felt far and wide, is when there was a call to action.

My final example focuses on prescribing patterns for patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, which is an example of ignorance rather than apathy.  In some hospitals in the US, there is hesitation and apprehension in prescribing pain medication for those suffering from Sickle Cell Anemia, because there is a perception that they are a ""drug seeking population"".  This has always been an issue close to my heart, because I've had a few family members suffer and subsequently succumb to it. And I've also encountered patients in my professional life.  Seeing up close and personal, how sicklers are stigmatized and classified as ""drug seekers"" is disparaging. But because it something that the vast majority of people will never experience, I can understand how people can't fully fathom what it's like to suffer from it, but it is not excusable that the majority of that population is penalized for the behaviors of the minority.

As members of a global community, we must be active and look out for humanity as a whole.  If we break out of the silo mentality and realize that we all affect one another, and if those in one part of the world are suffering that there are only a few degrees of separation, and we can ultimately be affected also, I think we will be better global citizens, if not for no other reason than realizing that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, and through our interest and participation, we can save those who might someday be able to return the favor.

,"I agree with you all. I also can't understand why even in low-to middle-income countries where there are professionally trained individuals, do not provide a quality of care that is expected by their profession.  From your example of the treatment of URI's I have the flashback image of the tubing for respirators that are non-reusable, being washed with soap and water and hung on clothes line to dry outside the ward in the open air of the hospital environment at the island's hospital to be re-used for other patients. Even more so, it's appalling when basic centrifugation for sterilization of instruments to provide surgical treatments are not available, or when donated medical devices are improperly stored, secured, or maintained and left to deteriorate to the elements, because of a lack of cross-training, compartmentalization, and a lack of understanding of how their role fits in to the bigger picture. 

I think even with the best access to care, if the personal pride in the assigned duties and the quality of service care provided is not a priority among personnel, then many of these diseases may not be mitigated. Two clinical examples come to mind, the nurse who left her 21 day quarantine to plan her wedding while being monitored for Ebola, and the numerous medical staff who do not wash their hands in-between patients, or clean their stethoscopes in between examinations and transfer diseases from patients to patients (*Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae* among other hospital acquired infections).","aat_door"

Why is it that all the individuals who returned to the US / contracted Ebola in the US have been able to survive Ebola and not succumb to the disease once contained (and there might be many answers here for that including genetic disposition) compared to the African counterparts, and if the containment of disease is dependent on the skilled and highly trained professionals going to Africa to help combat the disease (according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health - http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/fauci-returning-ebola-health-workers-shouldnt-face-draconian-rules-n234141), then why aren't we sending more workers and training individuals to make the impact needed to contain and fight this deadly outbreak?

"Most Important Global Health Issue","When I first read this question, my thoughts ran to Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Disease, Zoonoses, Viruses, Food Borne Diseases, along with Environmental Health as some of the larger themes for addressing universal infections to both humans and animals.

But as I reviewed this chapter and the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, I realized that there was no one answer to this question and indeed it was a multi-factorial and complexed situation.

I agree with many of the posts by fellow classmates that climate change, vector borne diseases, poverty & malnutrition, NCDs, maternal and child health, globalization and international travel all contribute to the global challenges threatening our health and future well-being.  But most of all, I think the socio-economic inequalities, disparities to health-care and access to basic services for quality life (running water, safe infrastructure, immunizations & vaccinations, nutrition, and so much more) as well as the sustainability of these resources and the solutions that are offered for these communities to thrive, in concert with ongoing universal primary education, are the most challenging and important issues to address to facilitate change and improvements for life.

Indeed, there is need for a multi-factorial solution and without the collaborative efforts of professionals in fields of human and veterinary medicine, business and economics, science and research and other sociological / humanities areas, we will only continue to touch the tip-of-the-iceberg and not address the depth of the situation and the root cause of the global challenges we face.","aat_door"

At the same time we have the humanization of pets, processed foods of dubious origin and much less exercise.

Without access to sufficient economic resources a population in an underdeveloped country cannot treat everyday illness, let alone an infectious disease outbreak. Liberia is the perfect example where an impoverished population is not able to contain the viral outbreak of Ebola. Here in America, where our overall wealth is no match for Liberia, we see a Fear based, stress reaction and exaggerated response to Ebola, allowing increased social unrest and political strife to thrive.

In the lecture on GI Motility (at ~6 min), the lecturer states that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by the UES not closing.

,"Hey Omeed- I just went through this lecture. The only reasoning I can come up with is the following: because phase 2 is dependent on the action of L-type calcium channels, meaning the time the myocytes remain in the plateau phase (phase 2) is dependent on how long the L-type calcium channels remain open. Changing the current through IKD during this phase will only change the y-axis of the graph (Vm)- increased efflux of K+ will cause the plateau part of the graph to move downward (along the y axis) toward more negative values but the timing of the phase (x- axis) will remain the same. This may be a wrong explanation. I am not 100% sure.   

The only way my reasoning can be correct, is if the L-type Ca channels do not open or close in response to the membrane potential. So, if current through IKD increased, thus causing a more negative membrane potential, the length of phase 2 can only stay the same if the L-type Ca channels remained open for the same amount of time.

"Heart Failure and RAAS","Hi everyone-

I am a little confused on the relationship between heart failure/decreased CO and RAAS activations. Many of the effects of AngII on the kidneys is to increase blood volume. I do not see how this can be helpful for a person with heart failure. I would think that increasing blood volume would put more stress on a heart that is already weak. I see that by increasing BV, the heart would work harder (increase SV), and thus increase CO, but that is not supportive of a person with heart failure. Right?

Any thoughts? Thank you.

Maen ","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"Hi- thanks for your input. I think the RAAS, like you said, may be a good short-term compensation mechanism (especially for acute blood loss), but for heart failure, chronic compensation by increasing blood volume can be an unwanted situation.

"Angiotensin II effect on GFR","Hi all,

I seem to be getting conflicting information on how ANG II effects GFR. From week #3, Dr. Clunes mentions that, in response to decreased CO and blood volume, ANGII will **decrease GFR** (to conserve blood volume). But in Dr. Powell's notes (""Control of Blood Pressure and Volume,"" P. 15), it shows that ANGII will increase efferent arteriolar resistance, and thus **increase GFR**, in response to decreased arterial pressure.

I am not sure if this has to do with the different scenarios (decreased blood volume versus decreased arterial pressure), which I think are the same thing.

Thanks","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"

"Respirtory Compensation in A/B","Hi all,

I am wondering about a specific statement made by Dr. Powell in her A/B lecture. She states that respiratory problems cannot be fixed with a respiratory response (14:16). I am just wondering why the central chemoreceptors triggered by increased carbon dioxide levels is not considered a respiratory response that fixes a respiratory problem. For example, in people with emphysema, increased blood CO2 levels can cause increased ventilation. Would this be considered respiratory compensation for a respiratory problem?

Also, according to Dr. Clunes lecture, peripheral chemoreceptors are triggered by arterial increases in H+ (acidosis)- which should compensate by increasing ventilation. 

Thank you.   ","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"Thanks for your feedback. 

But in general, can't you say that a healthy person that begins to hypoventilate (for what every reason) can fix the problem by increasing ventilation triggered by peripheral chemoreceptors that senses increased CO2. Obviously, the renal response can be elicited after chronic increase in CO2. 

After thinking about it for a while, I think the renal response (compensation) to a respiratory problem kicks in after chronic changes, while the chemoreceptor responses are for acute, fast changes.   ","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"Hi Dr. Murray,

Just so that I understand this correctly, central and peripheral chemoreceptors are able to respond (compensate) to acid/base changes in situations when the lung pathology is not affected- so a person's chemoreceptors are able to respond to hyperventilation in high altitdude by decreasing their ventilation? I am under the impression that chemorecptors are triggered by changes in H+/CO2 levels- so do they only respond to these changes if they are caused by metabolic problems?","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"The graphs were illustrated at around 27:00 minutes in the lecture ""Pleura and Pressures in the lung."" Dr. Clunes states that the top graph labeled as ""volume"" refers to ""lung volume."" I was not able to understand this in the context of the other graphs he drew.

Thank you.","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"Thanks for the explanation, Dr. Murray. 

My confusion is because the graph is showing that as the pressure in the alveolar is increasing back to atmospheric pressure, the ""volume of the lung"" is continuing to expand. How can it be possible for the alveolar pressure to increase while the volume of the lung is increasing? It would make more sense to me if the volume of air is increasing and thus the pressure in the alveolar is correspondingly increasing. More specifically, the volume graph should correspond to the tidal volume (the air entering and leaving the lungs) and not the volume of the lungs. Maybe the tidal volume and volume of the lung can be the same thing in this case. Is that possible?","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"
,"I think I get the different responses elicited in healthy versus sick individuals. 

My question is, in a healthy person, what IS the mechanism by which ""changes result in return to homeostasis?"" Can one of these mechanisms be the chemoreceptor response? For example, can someone that begins to hyperventilate (for what ever reason) stimulate the chemoreceptor response (triggered by decreased CO2) to slow down ventilation and return CO2 levels back to normal? If so, would this not be considered a compensatory response? ","mkaradsh@sgu.edu"

,"The way I understand it is that the chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic arch help regulate ventilation by monitoring changes in pH for a healthy individual.

ATP is no longer provided to operate the SERCA pumps in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which pump calcium ions into the terminal cisternae.[1] *This prevents calcium ions from leaving the muscle fibre and hence calcium ions keep on binding with troponin causing the cross-bridge to remain between myosin heads and actin proteins.* -- **INCREASED CALCIUM**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one group of conditions causing death globally. An estimated 17.5 million people died from CVDs in 2005, representing 30% of all global deaths. Over 80% of CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Another 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition and mostly preventable diseases, each year. Based on 2008 estimate by WHO, some 6.7 million people died of infectious diseases alone, far more than the number killed in the natural or man-made catastrophes that make headlines.  Likewise UNAIDS estimates for 2008, AIDS/HIV has spread rapidly representing 33.4 million living with HIV, 2.7 million new infections of HIV and 2 million deaths from AIDS. Tuberculosis kills 1.7 million people each year, with 9.4 million new cases a year. Malaria causes some 225 million acute illnesses and over 780,000 deaths, annually. Additionally, 164,000 people, mostly children under 5, died from measles in 2008 even though effective immunization costs less than 1 US dollars and has been available for more than 40 years.

The speed at which new pathogens are emerging is rising significantly, equally taking into account the increase in awareness and surveillance. Which pathogens will cross the species barrier next, and which one is the greatest potential public health concern, is a subject of intense interest. A modern outbreak, caused by a previously unknown virus, could travel with alacrity around the world, proliferating across the continents in just a few days, causing illness, panic and death.
 There are high probabilities that the world’s next pandemic will be a disease originating in animals, like the above current documented human infectious diseases. Yet after thousands of human deaths from zoonoses there is still inadequate information about how zoonoses are distributed or just how to forecast the subsequent epidemic. 
There is no question of whether we will have another zoonotic pandemic.  The question is merely when, and where, the next pandemic will emerge.

"What in your opinion is currently the most significant zoonotic disease risk to human populations","The observation that most emerging infectious disease of human are zoonosis, Less attention has be place on  domestic rodent species which are commensal and have caused significant illness and death to human and  animals and can significantly affect wildlife populations . The domestic rodent species have been hosts to numerous organisms that affect humans
The disease agents that cause these zoonotic diseases can be contracted from rodents directly by bites or contamination, or indirectly through the bite of arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and mites that have previously fed on an infected animal. These zoonotic diseases are primarily diseases acquired within a specific locality, and secondarily, diseases of occupation and avocation.

 Scientist, Entomologist, hunters, and other individuals who work directly with wildlife have an increased risk of acquiring these diseases directly from animal hosts or their ectoparasites. Plague, and leptospirosis have been acquired in the handling and skinning of rodents, and carnivores. Humans have usually acquired zoonotic diseases because they have spent time in optimal habitats of disease vectors and hosts. Therefore, some general precautions should be taken to reduce risks of exposure and preven

"HHow and which food from non-animal origin can be relevant to One Health One Medicine","Raw and undercooked vegetables and fruits which are dirt and parasite can be a potential food borne illness. Contaminated fruits and vegetables can determine foodborne illnesses.  Food can be cooked at a  temperature to reduce microbes. Because bacteria can grow well on the cut surface of fruit or vegetable, be careful not to contaminate these foods while slicing them up on the cutting board, and avoid leaving cut produce at room temperature for many hours. Orgasms such salmonella, E.coli can contaminate plant based products such as peanut or seed sprouts,

Good sanitation measures should be practice to prevent of organisms from contaminated fruit or vegetables to other.
Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables in running tap water to remove visible dirt and grime

"Environmental impact of global health research","It is widely accepted that high carbon usage and emission contributes to global climate change. Studies have reported that the likely direct health impacts of global climate change include those associated with an increase in heatwaves and a rise in vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Indirect health impacts may include sanitation problems secondary water shortages and malnutrition due to a rise in food costs as a result of reduced food production. People living in less developed regions are predicted to experience the greatest direct and indirect health impacts of climate change.","zakiul"
